One click and you're done. No shortcuts to memorize. No math. Layer stays put, no cap.

### 🛠️ Quick Tools

| Button | Function | What it do |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Purge** | Clear cache | RAM full? Hit it and it's gone! |
| **Null** | Create Null Object | Auto-parents selected layers, no stress |
| **Adj** | Adjustment Layer | Drop that adjustment layer real quick |
| **Text** | Text Layer | Spawns text dead center in your comp |

**Bonus:** Select a layer first → Null/Adj/Text will match that layer's timing automatically. We got you! 💯
